A real-time **Object Detection** application deployed as a **cloud-native microservice**.
It uses Facebook's **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** model to identify and locate objects within images with high precision.

## 🚀 Live Demo

👉 **Try the App here:**
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/Victor-dev18/Object-Detector-Live](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Victor-dev18/Object-Detector-Live)

> ⚠️ *Note:* The app runs on a **free-tier CPU instance**. The first detection may take **10–20 seconds** to warm up the model.

## 🧠 How It Works

This project demonstrates a **Serverless / Cloud-Native AI workflow**:

1. **Frontend** – Built with **Streamlit** for a clean, responsive UI
2. **Containerization** – Fully packaged using **Docker (Python 3.9-slim)** for environment consistency
3. **Model** – Uses `facebook/detr-resnet-50` from the Hugging Face Hub

   * End-to-end Transformer model
   * Treats object detection as a direct set prediction problem
4. **Deployment** – Automated build & deploy via **Hugging Face Spaces**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.9
* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **ML Libraries:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
* **Computer Vision:** PIL (Pillow), TIMM
* **DevOps / Cloud:** Docker, CI/CD Pipeline
